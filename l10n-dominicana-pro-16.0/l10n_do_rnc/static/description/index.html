        <div class="oe_span6">
            <p class='oe_mt32 text-justify'>
                There are two ways to look up the name with the contact's RNC / Cedula:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enter the RNC or Cedula in the contact's name field, the system will automatically search for the name in the available DGII database. If it cannot find it, the system will send you an error message indicating that it does not exist or is misspelled. If the user is certain that it exists and the system cannot find it, use the second method.</li>
                <li>Enter the company's name and RNC / Cedula when creating the contact, the system will look up the contact's RNC/Cedula name and will place the correct name. If it cannot find it, it will simply create the contact in a forced manner.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If a contact with a valid tax identification number (RNC) or ID already exists, the system will issue a warning to the user, indicating that they cannot create the contact, as this module restricts the creation of contacts with existing RNCs.
